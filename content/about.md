Hi, my name is Mahima Kriti. Welcome to my blog. I am a software developer by profession but data viz is my passion.In this blog, I post about things I explore in the data analytics domain. I am fascinated by data visualisation particularly as it helps paint a very memorable picture about data. For example, do we really understand how much 1 billion dollars is (You can see such visualisations [here](https://informationisbeautiful.net/topic/money-economy/)).<br>
