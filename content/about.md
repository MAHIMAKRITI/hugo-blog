> Furthermore, the two cornerstones of experiential learning as a part of MAM at the London Business School - the LondonLAB and Global Immersion Field Trip (GIFT) - will improve my learning manifold, by helping me further apply the theoretical concepts I acquire in the classroom through hands-on experience with actual business problems. Besides, diversity is at the very heart of the MAM programme; being surrounded by peers and faculty of different backgrounds, cultures and experience levels will foster my holistic development, thereby moulding me as a well-rounded professional with a global perspective. Additionally, I am excited to bolster my novice proficiency in Spanish since learning a second language is an exit criterion for MAM at LBS.
