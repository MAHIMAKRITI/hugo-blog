One of 90's most successful sitcom Friends, is my absolute all time favorite show to watch. The show follows the lives of six reckless adults living in Manhattan, as they indulge in adventures which make their lives both troublesome and happening.


There are **235** Friends epsiodes and ten seasons.

The first visualization I made was of the episode ratings of the entire series, grouped by season. The width of the violin plot indicates the density of the episodes with that particular rating.

Season 4 had one of the lowest rated epsiodes while the last episode of the show had the highest rating.<br>
I also wanted to look into who wrote the episodes and see if there were any particular writers who did the most episodes.

Kevin Bright and Gary Holvorson each directed fifty-four episodes each while David Schwimmer(Ross) also put on his director hat on and directed ten episodes.

As I was interested to see what names appeared most in the episode titles, so I made a wordcloud of hhe episode titles. The name of the titular characters do seem to be equally used except Rachel's name which seems a bit more pronounced than the others.
