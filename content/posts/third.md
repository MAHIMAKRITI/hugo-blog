![From 2006 to 2016, the number of men and women not marrying has increased](/images/nevermarried_viz.png "From 2006 to 2016, the number of men and women not marrying has increased")

According to the [US Census](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2021/demo/p70-167.pdf) from 2006 to 2016 the number of men and women not marrying is on the rise. This rise is visible across people of all age groups. The objective of this notebook is to create visualisations to demonstrate the change and also explore the seaborn library.
